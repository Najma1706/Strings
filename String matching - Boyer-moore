Problem Statement
Jinu is working on a project where he needs to efficiently search for a pattern within a given text. He wants to implement a program that can count the occurrences of a pattern within the provided text using the Boyer-Moore algorithm.

Write a program to help Jinu implement this pattern-searching functionality. The program should take a text string and a pattern string as input, and it should output the count of occurrences of the pattern within the text.

Input format :
The first line of input contains a text string, text, consisting of printable ASCII characters.

The second line of input contains a pattern string, pattern, consisting of printable ASCII characters.

Output format :
The output prints a single integer representing the count of occurrences of the pattern within the given text.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following specifications:

The length of text will not exceed 100 characters.

The length of pattern will not exceed 100 characters.

The input string must be case-sensitive.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
ababababa
ab
Output 1 :
4
Input 2 :
Hello, how are you doing? How is everything going?
How
Output 2 :
1

    while(i<=n-m) {
        int j=m-1;
        while(j>=0 && txt[i+j]==pat[j]){
            j--;
        }
        if(j<0) {
            count++;
            if(i+m<n)
            i+=m-bad[txt[i+m]];
            else i++;
        }
        else {
            i+=max(1,j-bad[txt[i+j]]);
        }
    }
    cout<<count;
